- [x] See the first movie's details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets when the page loads. 
- [x] See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page when the page loads.
- [x] Buy a ticket for a movie. 
- [x] Delete a film from the server. 
- [x] When a movie is sold out (when there are no available tickets remaining), indicate that the movie is sold out by changing the button text to "Sold Out".
